<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student in Arizona State University, USA. I am working in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Yanjie Fu](https://www.yanjiefu.com), specializing in Causal AI and Explainable AI.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I was working as a Software Development Engineer for 3 years in Alexa AI at Amazon and in Financial Projections at Fidelity Investments that laid a solid industrial exposure for my research interests.

I am also an avid photographer and a passionate programming teacher training young people excited about creative problem solving.

Interests: Causal Graph Learning, Generative AI, Explainable AI solutions for complex real-time industrial infrastructure problems.
